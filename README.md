# Directory Structure Viewer

This Python script allows you to view the structure of a directory and optionally save it to a text file.

## Usage

1. Run the script by entering the full path to the target folder.
2. The script will display the directory structure in a tree-like format.
3. Optionally, you can choose to save the directory structure to a text file.

## Instructions

1. **Enter the full path to the folder or 'exit' to quit:**
   - Provide the full path to the folder you want to explore.

2. **Folder structure:**
   - The script will display the structure of the specified folder.

3. **Do you want to save the directory structure to a text file? (yes/no):**
   - If you choose 'yes', enter the full path for the text file (including filename).
   - If you choose 'no', the script will continue to the next iteration.

4. Repeat the process or type 'exit' to quit.

## Example

```bash
Enter the full path to the folder or 'exit' to quit: C:\Users\Username\Documents\Projects
